# Craft X Furigana

This is a simple extension that allows you to use [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) in your Craft documents.

To use it, wrap your text in curly brackets and separate the main text with the super-script text with a pipe, like so:

```
{元気|げんき}
```

You can use normal curly brackets and pipes, or the Japanese equivalents!

```
｛元気｜げんき｝
```

Furigana is not just useful when writing in Japanese, it's also [useful in English!](https://twitter.com/mabel0id/status/1381043149125074946)

You can also select the text you want to add furigana to, then click a button in the extension and add your furigana.

## Building

Simply run `npm install` and than `npm run build` to generate the .craftX file which can be installed.
